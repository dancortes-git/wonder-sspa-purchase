# Wonder - Purchase - Micro Frontend

This project is a Micro Frontend build with Single SPA (create-single-spa). It is used to build the Sign In and Sign Up pages of the application.

This is a simple todo task list project, each task created is a card with title, message and an random image from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos).

For styling I used [Material UI](https://material-ui.com).

There are some interesting features included like:

+ Authentication
+ Public and private navigation
+ Simple state management

This Micro Frontend was made based on [Wonder Monolith](https://github.com/dancortes-git/wonder-monolith).

The main purpose of this project is to learn more about Micro Frontends using Single SPA.
